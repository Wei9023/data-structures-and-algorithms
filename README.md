Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout this repo, I will complete a set of daily code challenges. Each set will contain up to ten problems.


# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge is how to get the element from the end of the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I reverse the array by define a new array and push the element of the array from last to first.

## Solution

# Insert and shift an array in middle at index
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge is how to put the number to be added into the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I find the middle index first and then move those numbers behind and make an empty position for the number to be added

# Binary search in a sorted array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge is how to change the middle point automatically and continue the process untill find the target number.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 After deciding which side to choose adjust the start index and end index
