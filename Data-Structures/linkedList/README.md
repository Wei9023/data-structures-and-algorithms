# Singly Linked List
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
2. Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
3. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.
4. Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
5. Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
6. Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
7. Append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
8. InsertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
9. InsertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## ChallengeCan successfully instantiate an empty linked list
1. Can properly insert into the linked list
2. The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
3. Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
4. Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
5. Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
6. Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
7. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
8. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
9. Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
10. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
11. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
12. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
