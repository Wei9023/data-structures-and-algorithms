# Trees
Implement a Tree
![Travis](./tree.png)

## Challenge
### Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
### Create a BinaryTree class
* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
* At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

### Create a BinarySearchTree class
* Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## API
inorder(node);
preorder(node);
postorder(node);
add(data);
contain(value);


# breadth_first
Breadth-first Traversal
![](./breadthfirst.png)

## Challenge
* Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

# find_maximum_binary_tree
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
![](./max.png)

## Challenge
Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
